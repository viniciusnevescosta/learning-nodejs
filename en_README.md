## Overview

This project is part of my learning journey, where I delved into web development with NodeJs, MongoDB and Express. The proposal was to create a CRUD API to manage users.

## Technologies Used

- **NodeJs:** The engine that drives the entire application, allowing JavaScript code to be executed on the server side.
- **MongoDB:** The NoSQL database that stores and retrieves user data.
- **Express:** The framework that simplifies the construction of web applications with NodeJs, facilitating the creation of routes and middleware.

## Functionalities

1. **User Registration:**
    - Create new user records, providing information such as name, email and password.

2. **User Inquiry:**
    - Retrieve details of existing users via API queries.

3. **Data Update:**
    - Update user information, keeping the database always up to date.

4. **User Removal:**
    - Delete users that are no longer needed, keeping the database clean.

## How to Test

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/viniciusnevescosta/learning-nodejs.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd learning-nodejs
    pnpm i
    ```

3. **Configure the Environment:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root and provide the necessary environment variables:<br><br>
    ```env
    MONGODB_USERNAME=your_mongodb_user
    MONGODB_PASSWORD=your_mongodb_password
    ```

4. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    pnpm start:dev
    ```

5. **Explore the API:**
    - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and use the defined ```/users``` route to interact with the API.

## Learning Acquired

During the construction of this project, I gained valuable knowledge, including:

- üöÄ In-depth understanding of the NodeJs environment and its role in web development.
- üìä Practical experience in integrating and manipulating data with MongoDB.
- üåê RESTful API routing and creation skills using the Express framework.
